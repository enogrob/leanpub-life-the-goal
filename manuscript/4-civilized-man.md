# Civilized Man 

BY A CIVILIZED MAN I do not mean a man who has mastered the machinery of modern life. Civilization is the outcome of that culture which is the distinctive expression of the individual perception of Truth. 

A civilized man must first of all not ask anything for himself from anyone, and must not want anything for himself. That is the first requirement, according to my point of view, for a civilized man, a cultured man. Now, if he must not ask anything from another, it means that he is a standard unto himself, a lamp unto himself, and then he will cast no shadow across the path of another. He is not limited by fear of external authority, by the fear of an unknown god, by superstitions, by traditions, because the moment he relies upon another, his perception of the Truth will diminish. 

Then, he must be dominated by intuition, which is the highest point of intelligence -- by intelligence I mean the accumulation, the residue of all experience, - and from that comes intuition. And if you would awaken that intuition, which must of necessity be the only guide, the only influence, you must keep your intelligence enthusiastically awakened. 

Then, a civilized man, a cultured man must be tolerant, must be able to discuss any subject impartially, without prejudice, he must be unbiased, capable of a critical examination of anything new before rejecting or accepting it. Most people in the world are dominated by fear, fear of the unknown, fear of superstition, fear of prejudice, fear of desires, fear of gods, fear of beliefs, systems, and philosophies. A civilized or cultured man must have no fear, because I hold that the truly cultured man, in the right sense of the word in which I am using it, is the highest form of spiritual attainment. Such a man has truly attained, such a man has truly taken to his heart the waters of life. And as the waters wander, so he wanders in the world, desiring nothing, fearing nothing, wanting nothing for himself. And that can only be arrived at if the goal is the final arbiter, the final authority. Such a man is simple, such a man is pure. He is clear and calm as the mountain in the morning, because he has arrived where he is absolutely free from all experience, because he has been through every experience. Such a man has fulfilled his life, because he has let life paint the picture it wishes, and not he, by his narrowness, by his limitations, warped and corrupted life.
