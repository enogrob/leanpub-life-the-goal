# Direct Path  

TO CLIMB HIGH, you must begin low. To go far, you must begin near. To reach the mountaintop you must first pass through the shadows of the valley. 

And, oh friend, because I have wandered in the valley, because I have dwelt among the shadows, because I have suffered and I have loved, out of the fullness of my heart I would tell you that the direct path is the only path, that the simple union is best. And when you have understood this path, when you have achieved this union, time and all the complications of time will cease. Then you will be your own Master, your own God, your own Light. And when once you have realized that, all other things will be secondary and hence unnecessary.
